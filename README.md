# Pokedex-Blackberry
Pokedex BlackBerry app. App allows users to view the latest information (such as HP, attack stats, etc.) about their latest Pokemon from the latest generations. 

Can be run and tested simply by using the BlackBerry SDK. 


Note: Numerous commits were made with my mom's laptop (Antonia), hence why most of the commits were made under her name. The inital commits were made by my professor, Dr. Jagath Samarabandu, for the inital part of the project.
